I am currently at post doctoral researcher at [sky-lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) (previously called RISE), UC Berkeley with [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) working on futuristic AI systems with a focus on efficiency. Previously, I did my Ph.D. at Rice University advised by Dr. [Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/) in 2024. Here is my [thesis](https://repository.rice.edu/items/47c844ea-4748-4751-8123-fd4182c635ee). 

In a previous life, I used to be strategist at [Tower Research Capital](https://tower-research.com/) where I spent quite some time after graduating from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) in 2013. At IIT Kanpur, I was fortunate to work with Dr. [Subhajit Roy](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/subhajit/), Dr. [Mark Marron](https://software.imdea.org/~marron/) and Dr. [Sumit Gulwani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumitg/) from Microsoft Research on Progamming Language research.
